### Some background and details
This is my first ever complete React project. It probably doesn't follow every principle and rule of the framework 100% but eh, for now, if it works it works. This is just a small project I did for my boss. I work for a sushi restaurant as a food delivery guy, and one day he found out I was into coding and we agreed to create this project for him to manage.
